      <p>
        Managing group expenses can quickly become confusing — especially when different people pay for different things.
        ExpenseSplit is designed to make group expense management simple, transparent, and stress-free.
      </p>

      <h2>What Is Group Expense Management?</h2>
      <p>
        Group expense management is the process of tracking shared costs and ensuring everyone pays their fair share.
        This is common during trips, shared housing, group dinners, or any situation where multiple people contribute money.
      </p>

      <p>
        Without a clear system, misunderstandings and disagreements can arise.
        Using a dedicated expense split calculator helps avoid confusion and keeps everything fair.
      </p>
