      <h2>What is ExpenseSplit?</h2>
      <p>
        ExpenseSplit is a free online expense split calculator designed to help
        people quickly and fairly divide shared expenses. Whether you're traveling
        with friends, living with roommates, or managing group outings, ExpenseSplit
        makes it easy to see who owes whom — without creating accounts or installing apps.
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea behind ExpenseSplit is simplicity. Many expense tracking tools are
        overloaded with features, logins, and complex workflows. ExpenseSplit focuses
        only on what most people actually need: a fast and clear way to split expenses
        and settle balances.
