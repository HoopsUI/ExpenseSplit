      <p>
        ExpenseSplit was created to solve a very common everyday problem — splitting shared expenses
        fairly without confusion, awkward conversations, or complicated apps.
        Whether it’s a group dinner, a shared apartment, or a trip with friends,
        calculating who owes what should be simple and stress-free.
      </p>

      <h2>Why ExpenseSplit Exists</h2>
      <p>
        Many expense-splitting apps today are overloaded with features, accounts, notifications,
        and unnecessary complexity. ExpenseSplit takes a different approach.
        It focuses on doing one thing well: helping people divide expenses quickly and fairly,
        without requiring signups, downloads, or personal data.
      </p>

      <p>
        The goal is to provide a lightweight, browser-based expense split calculator that works
        instantly on any device — desktop, tablet, or mobile.
      </p>

      <h2>Who Is ExpenseSplit For?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Friends splitting restaurant bills, parties, or casual expenses</li>
        <li>Roommates managing rent, utilities, groceries, and shared household costs</li>
        <li>Groups planning trips, vacations, or weekend getaways</li>
        <li>Anyone who wants a fast, clear, and fair way to split expenses</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Simple, Fair, and Transparent</h2>
      <p>
        ExpenseSplit is designed with transparency in mind.
        Every calculation is straightforward, easy to understand, and visible to everyone involved.
        There are no hidden rules, no confusing formulas, and no locked features for basic use.
      </p>

      <p>
        The basic calculator is completely free and accessible to everyone.
        You can use it as often as you like, without limits or interruptions.
      </p>

      <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
      <p>
        ExpenseSplit is continuously improving.
        While the current focus is on keeping the core experience simple and reliable,
        more advanced tools may be introduced in the future for users who need them.
        These additions will always respect the original goal: simplicity first.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you’re looking for a clean, no-nonsense way to split expenses,
        ExpenseSplit is built for you.
