      <h2>1. Add All Participants Before Entering Expenses</h2>
      <p>
        Always start by adding everyone involved in the expense group. Missing a participant can lead to incorrect calculations and unfair splits.
        Whether you're splitting costs with friends, roommates, or during a trip, accuracy starts with complete participant lists.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Enter Expenses as They Happen</h2>
      <p>
        To avoid forgetting amounts or who paid, enter expenses immediately after they occur.
        This keeps totals accurate and prevents disputes later when settling balances.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Be Clear About Who Paid</h2>
      <p>
        ExpenseSplit allows you to specify who paid for each expense.
        Double-check this step — incorrect payer selection is the most common cause of mismatched balances.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Split Only Among Relevant People</h2>
      <p>
        Not all expenses are shared equally. For example, a taxi ride may include only some participants.
        Make sure each expense is split only among the people who benefited from it.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Review Totals Before Settling</h2>
      <p>
        Before settling payments, review the calculated balances carefully.
        ExpenseSplit provides a clear summary so everyone understands who owes whom and how much.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Use Screenshots for Transparency</h2>
      <p>
        Sharing a screenshot of the final summary helps avoid misunderstandings.
        This is especially useful for group trips or shared living situations.
      </p>

      <h2>Common Mistakes to Avoid</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Forgetting to include someone in the group</li>
        <li>Entering incorrect expense amounts</li>
        <li>Assigning expenses to the wrong payer</li>
        <li>Not reviewing totals before settling</li>
      </ul>
