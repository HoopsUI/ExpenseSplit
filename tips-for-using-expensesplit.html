      <h1>Tips for Using ExpenseSplit Effectively</h1>

      <p>
        ExpenseSplit is designed to be simple, fast, and frustration-free. There are no accounts, no syncing issues, and no learning curve. Still, how you use an expense calculator can make a big difference in how fair and clear the final result feels to everyone involved.
      </p>

      <p>
        Below are practical, real-world tips to help you get the most accurate and stress-free results when using ExpenseSplit — whether you’re splitting costs with friends, roommates, or travel companions.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Agree on the Rules Before Entering Expenses</h2>

      <p>
        Before adding numbers into the calculator, make sure everyone in the group agrees on what is being split. Decide early whether certain expenses are shared equally or handled separately.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, during a trip, accommodation and transport might be shared by everyone, while personal shopping or optional activities should be excluded. Clear rules upfront prevent confusion and awkward conversations later.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once expectations are aligned, you can confidently use the main <a href="index.html">ExpenseSplit calculator</a> without needing adjustments afterward.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Enter Expenses as They Happen</h2>

      <p>
        One of the most common causes of incorrect splits is forgetting expenses. Instead of waiting until the end of the day or trip, try entering expenses as soon as they occur.
      </p>

      <p>
        ExpenseSplit works instantly in your browser, so you can open it anytime on your phone or laptop. This habit reduces memory errors and ensures every payment is accounted for.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you’re on a journey, the <a href="trip.html">Trip Expense Calculator</a> page is especially helpful for tracking shared travel costs in real time.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Use Clear Names for Participants</h2>

      <p>
        When adding people to the calculator, use recognizable names instead of initials or vague labels. This is particularly important in larger groups where multiple people might have similar names or roles.
      </p>

      <p>
        Clear participant names make the final balance summary easier to understand and reduce disputes about who paid for what.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Don’t Overcomplicate Small Differences</h2>

      <p>
        Expense splitting does not need to be mathematically perfect down to the last cent. If the difference is extremely small, it may be better to round off amounts to keep things simple.
      </p>

      <p>
        ExpenseSplit gives you a clear overview of balances, but how strictly you enforce exact numbers is up to the group. Simplicity often leads to smoother settlements.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Use Specialized Pages for Common Scenarios</h2>

      <p>
        While the main calculator works for most situations, ExpenseSplit also offers dedicated pages for common use cases:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="roommates.html">Roommates Expense Calculator</a> — ideal for rent, utilities, and shared household costs</li>
        <li><a href="friends.html">Friends Expense Calculator</a> — useful for outings, parties, and casual group spending</li>
        <li><a href="trip.html">Trip Expense Calculator</a> — designed for travel-specific expenses</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Using the most relevant page helps you think clearly about the type of expenses being split.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Double-Check Before Settling</h2>

      <p>
        Before asking people to settle balances, take a moment to review the entered amounts together. A quick review ensures no expense was missed or added incorrectly.
      </p>

      <p>
        This step builds trust and transparency, especially in groups where people are sensitive about money matters.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Keep Privacy in Mind</h2>

      <p>
        ExpenseSplit does not store any data or require signups. Once you close the page or refresh the browser, your entries are gone.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you need a record, consider taking a screenshot or writing down final balances. This keeps everything private and under your control.
      </p>

      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

      <p>
        ExpenseSplit works best when combined with clear communication and simple rules. By following these tips, you can avoid misunderstandings, save time, and focus on enjoying the experience instead of worrying about calculations.
