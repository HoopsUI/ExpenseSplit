      <h1>Tips for Using ExpenseSplit Effectively</h1>

      <p>
        ExpenseSplit is designed to be simple, fast, and privacy-friendly. There are no accounts, no data storage, and no setup required. However, how you use an expense calculator can make a big difference in clarity and fairness within a group.
      </p>

      <p>
        These practical tips will help you use ExpenseSplit with confidence, reduce misunderstandings, and ensure that everyone feels comfortable with the final outcome.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Agree on the Rules Before Entering Expenses</h2>

      <p>
        Before adding anything to the calculator, make sure everyone in the group agrees on what expenses will be shared and what will be personal. Setting expectations early avoids confusion and disagreements later.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Add Expenses as Soon as They Happen</h2>

      <p>
        Waiting until later to add expenses can lead to forgetting or misremembering amounts. ExpenseSplit works instantly in your browser, so enter expenses as they occur. This keeps your totals accurate.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Use Clear Names for Participants</h2>

      <p>
        When adding participant names, use recognizable, consistent names instead of initials or vague labels. This makes the final summary easier to read and understand for everyone.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Keep It Simple</h2>

      <p>
        Expense splitting doesn’t always need to be exact down to the last cent. If the difference is very small, rounding up or down slightly can keep things simple and friendly.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Choose the Right Calculator Page</h2>

      <p>
        ExpenseSplit offers dedicated pages for common use cases. These pages help you stay organized and think clearly about the types of expenses you are splitting:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="roommates.html">Roommates Expense Calculator</a> — for rent, utilities, and household costs</li>
        <li><a href="friends.html">Friends Expense Calculator</a> — for outings, dinners, and group activities</li>
        <li><a href="trip.html">Trip Expense Calculator</a> — for travel expenses</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Review Before Settling</h2>

      <p>
        Before settling balances, take a moment to review all inputs together. This builds trust and ensures that no expense was missed or entered incorrectly.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Remember Your Privacy</h2>

      <p>
        ExpenseSplit does not store any data or require signups. Once the page is refreshed or closed, everything is cleared. If you need a record, consider taking a screenshot of the final results.
      </p>

      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

      <p>
        ExpenseSplit works best when combined with clear communication and simple rules. Following these tips will help you focus on your experience instead of worrying about calculations.
