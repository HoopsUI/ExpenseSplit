      <h1>Tips for Using ExpenseSplit Effectively</h1>

      <p>
        ExpenseSplit is built to be simple, fast, and privacy-friendly. There are no accounts, no data storage, and no setup required. However, how you use an expense-splitting tool can significantly impact clarity and fairness within a group.
      </p>

      <p>
        These practical tips will help you use ExpenseSplit more effectively, reduce misunderstandings, and ensure that everyone feels comfortable with the final outcome.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Set Clear Expectations First</h2>

      <p>
        Before entering any numbers, make sure everyone agrees on which expenses are shared and which are personal. This avoids confusion later and ensures the calculator reflects real agreements, not assumptions.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, shared accommodation and transport costs may be split equally, while optional activities or personal purchases should be excluded.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Add Expenses as They Occur</h2>

      <p>
        Waiting until the end of the day or trip to enter expenses often leads to forgotten payments. ExpenseSplit works instantly in your browser, so it’s best to enter expenses as soon as they happen.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is especially useful when using the <a href="trip.html">Trip Expense Calculator</a>, where multiple payments occur throughout the day.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Use Clear Participant Names</h2>

      <p>
        Always use recognizable names instead of initials or vague labels. This helps everyone understand the final balance summary without confusion, especially in larger groups.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Keep Things Simple</h2>

      <p>
        Not every split needs to be mathematically perfect. If differences are very small, rounding amounts can help keep settlements simple and friendly.
      </p>

      <p>
        ExpenseSplit gives you clarity — how strictly you apply the numbers is up to your group.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Choose the Right Calculator Page</h2>

      <p>
        ExpenseSplit offers dedicated pages for common situations:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="roommates.html">Roommates</a> — rent, utilities, and household bills</li>
        <li><a href="friends.html">Friends</a> — outings, parties, and shared activities</li>
        <li><a href="trip.html">Trips</a> — travel and vacation expenses</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Using the appropriate page helps you stay organized and think clearly about the type of expenses involved.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Review Before Settling</h2>

      <p>
        Before asking anyone to settle balances, quickly review all entered expenses together. This builds trust and ensures no mistakes were made.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Remember Your Privacy</h2>

      <p>
        ExpenseSplit does not save any data. Once the page is refreshed or closed, everything is cleared. If you need a record, consider taking a screenshot of the final results.
      </p>

      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

      <p>
        ExpenseSplit works best when combined with clear communication and simple rules. By following these tips, you can avoid unnecessary tension and focus on enjoying your time together.
