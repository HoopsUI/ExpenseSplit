      <h2>1. Add Everyone First</h2>
      <p>
        Before entering any expenses, make sure you add all participants who are involved.
        Whether you’re splitting costs with roommates, friends, or during a trip, having everyone listed upfront avoids confusion later.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Enter Expenses as They Happen</h2>
      <p>
        For the most accurate results, enter expenses as soon as they occur.
        This helps prevent forgotten payments and ensures each expense is assigned to the correct person.
      </p>

      <h2>3. Be Clear About Who Paid</h2>
      <p>
        Always double-check the payer selection when entering an expense.
        ExpenseSplit calculates balances based on who paid and who shared the cost, so accuracy here is essential.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Use Descriptions for Clarity</h2>
      <p>
        Adding short descriptions like “Dinner”, “Taxi”, or “Groceries” helps everyone understand what each expense was for.
        This is especially useful when reviewing expenses later or resolving disputes.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Split Only Among Relevant People</h2>
      <p>
        Not every expense needs to be split among all participants.
        If only certain people shared a cost, make sure to select only those individuals.
        This keeps calculations fair and realistic.
      </p>

      <h2>6. Review Before Calculating</h2>
      <p>
        Before clicking calculate, quickly review all entries.
        Small mistakes like extra zeros or incorrect names can change the final result significantly.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Use the Results to Settle Quickly</h2>
      <p>
        Once the calculation is complete, you can easily see who owes whom.
        Share the results with your group or take a screenshot to settle balances smoothly.
      </p>
