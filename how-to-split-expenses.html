        Splitting expenses can quickly become confusing — especially when multiple people
        pay for different things. Whether you're traveling with friends, sharing rent with
        roommates, or managing group outings, keeping track of who owes whom is essential.
      </p>

      <p>
        ExpenseSplit was created to make this process simple. Our free calculators help you
        split expenses fairly without logins, sign-ups, or spreadsheets.
      </p>

      <h2>Why Splitting Expenses Often Becomes Complicated</h2>
      <p>
        Many people start by casually dividing costs, but problems arise when:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Different people pay at different times</li>
        <li>Expenses are uneven or shared partially</li>
        <li>Someone forgets past payments</li>
        <li>Manual calculations lead to mistakes</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This is where a dedicated expense-splitting calculator becomes extremely useful.
        Instead of guessing or manually calculating balances, ExpenseSplit handles it instantly.
