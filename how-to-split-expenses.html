      <h2>Step 2: Enter Participants</h2>
      <p>
        Add the names of all people who are sharing expenses. You can include friends, roommates, or colleagues.
        Make sure everyone is accounted for so the split is accurate.

      <h2>Step 3: Add Expenses</h2>

      <h2>Step 5: Tips for Accuracy</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Double-check amounts before submitting.</li>
        <li>Use clear participant names to avoid confusion.</li>
        <li>Enter expenses as they occur for the most accurate results.</li>
