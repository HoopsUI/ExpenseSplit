      <h1>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h1>

      <p>
        This FAQ answers the most common questions people have when using ExpenseSplit. If you’re new to the calculator or just want clarity on how things work, you’ll find practical answers below.
      </p>

      <h2>What is ExpenseSplit?</h2>

      <p>
        ExpenseSplit is a free, browser-based expense split calculator that helps groups divide shared costs fairly. It works instantly without requiring signups, downloads, or personal data.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can use it for trips, shared housing, outings with friends, or any situation where multiple people contribute to expenses.
      </p>

      <h2>Do I need to create an account?</h2>

      <p>
        No. ExpenseSplit does not require accounts, logins, or registration of any kind. You simply open the calculator and start using it.
      </p>

      <p>
        This makes ExpenseSplit faster to use and more privacy-friendly than many expense-tracking apps.
      </p>

      <h2>Is ExpenseSplit really free?</h2>

      <p>
        Yes. The basic calculator is completely free to use. There are no hidden fees, subscriptions, or paywalls.
      </p>

      <p>
        The goal is to keep ExpenseSplit simple and accessible for everyday use without forcing users into premium plans.
      </p>

      <h2>Does ExpenseSplit save my data?</h2>

      <p>
        No. ExpenseSplit does not store your data on any server or database. All calculations happen directly in your browser.
      </p>

      <p>
        Once you refresh or close the page, your entered data is cleared. If you need a record, you can manually save the results.
      </p>

      <h2>Can I use ExpenseSplit on my phone?</h2>

      <p>
        Yes. ExpenseSplit is fully responsive and works on both desktop and mobile devices. You can access it from any modern browser without installing an app.
      </p>

      <p>
        This makes it especially useful while traveling or when expenses occur on the go.
      </p>

      <h2>What types of expenses can I split?</h2>

      <p>
        ExpenseSplit can be used for almost any shared expense, including:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Travel costs like accommodation, transport, and food</li>
        <li>Roommate expenses such as rent, utilities, and groceries</li>
        <li>Group outings, parties, and shared activities</li>
        <li>Any situation where multiple people pay at different times</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        You can also use dedicated pages like the <a href="trip.html">Trip</a>, <a href="roommates.html">Roommates</a>, and <a href="friends.html">Friends</a> calculators for common scenarios.
      </p>

      <h2>Can I split expenses unevenly?</h2>

      <p>
        Yes. ExpenseSplit supports situations where people contribute different amounts. You simply enter what each person paid, and the calculator determines who owes whom.
      </p>

      <p>
        This flexibility makes it suitable for real-life spending patterns rather than forcing equal payments.
      </p>

      <h2>What if someone didn’t participate in all expenses?</h2>

      <p>
        It’s best to exclude personal or optional expenses that don’t apply to everyone. Agree on what counts as a shared cost before entering numbers.
      </p>

      <p>
        For guidance on handling such situations, see the <a href="how-to-split-expenses.html">How to Split Expenses</a> guide.
      </p>

      <h2>Is ExpenseSplit accurate?</h2>

      <p>
        Yes. ExpenseSplit uses straightforward math to calculate balances. Accuracy depends on entering correct amounts and agreeing on what expenses are shared.
      </p>

      <p>
        Double-checking entries before settling balances is always recommended.
      </p>

      <h2>Can I use ExpenseSplit offline?</h2>

      <p>
        ExpenseSplit requires an internet connection to load the page initially. Once loaded, basic functionality may continue to work depending on your browser, but full offline support is not guaranteed.
      </p>

      <h2>Where can I learn best practices?</h2>
